<h2>Work done so far</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Deliverable updates</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Plan to Achieve<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                MCTS search system: Implement a simple rollout policy to play
                random games, choose a final move, and report results to the
                master process. The rollout policy will estimate the
                probability of winning for various legal moves. For each move
                evaluated, the rollout will do MCTS up to a certain depth by
                choosing random legal moves for each player, then find the
                score of that partial game by evaluating it with a basic
                heuristic (number of captures + number of stones placed on
                board).
            </li>

            <li>
                Parallelize the rollout policy to do rollouts for multiple
                actions simultaneously.
            </li>

            <li>
                Train a neural network to implement a move policy. This move
                policy is a probability distribution over all legal moves of a
                given board state and player. The NN will be trained on
                high-ranking amateur games of Go, and will be trained to
                predict a move that a player makes given a board. This NN will
                be used in the MCTS search system for a more sensible move
                policy than random legal moves.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hope to Achieve<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Train a neural network to implement a value network. Given
                a board state, a value network evaluates the probability
                of winning. This will be used in the rollout policy
                instead of the scoring heuristic to improve the policy
                results.
            </li>

            <li>
                Implement a smarter search policy that chooses which
                actions to evaluate during the rollout. We would aim for
                having a higher probability for moves that will have the
                highest evaluation.
            </li>

            <li>
                Distribute MCTS rollout to multiple machines.
            </li>

    <p style="color:#000"><b>Go</b> is a total-knowledge two-player
    board game focused on placing pieces to surround territory and
    capture the opponent&rsquo;s pieces. Until recently, it has been
    infeasible to create a strong Go AI because the branching factor
    of the move tree is incredibly high, making exhaustive search, and
    even A/B pruning, infeasible.</p>

    <p style="color:#000">The state of the art in computer Go
    has been <b>Monte Carlo Tree Search</b>, a probabilistic method for
    finding and evaluating move sequences by playing random games,
    with the probabilities of each move given by some function of the
    current board state. Modern AIs have begun using Convolutional
    Neural Networks to assign these probabilities and estimate the
    value of a board state without needing to traverse fully down the
    move tree. Google DeepMind&rsquo;s AlphaGo software recently used
    this technique to repeatedly defeat some of the best professional
    Go players in the world.</p>

    <p style="color:#000"><b>Convolutional Neural Networks</b> are
    commonly used for object recognition and other image processing
    techniques where other algorithmic techniques are either
    insufficient or too costly to develop. If large labelled datasets
    are available, a CNN can provide a high level of precision with
    comparatively little development time. Since a Go board can be
    viewed as a 19x19 image with 3 possible values (black, white,
    open) for each pixels, CNNs can operate on the current board state
    as though it were an image.</p>

<p> <h2>The three main parts of this project would
    be:</h2>

</p>

<ol start="1"> <li>
    <span>A simple web interface to allow a user to view the board
    state and make moves.</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>A master process, which aggregates the
        results of the MCTS search and plays the best available move,
    updating the web interface at the same time.</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>An MCTS search system, which plays random
        games and reports the results to the master process.</span>

    </li>

</ol>

<p> <span> </span>

</p>

<p> <span>The main opportunities for parallelism are in the
    MCTS search. The random games are independent of each other, and
    thus can be distributed across multiple threads, or even across
    different machines. The only data dependency across these threads
    is the current board state, which can be sent to the search
    threads asynchronously from the master process. There are still
    opportunities to add sharing to minimize duplicate computation --
    eg. sharing neural network outputs on specific board states,
    marking branches with their current valuation to optionally bias
    the random games, etc. Finally, CNN evaluation can be offloaded to
    the GPU for increased parallelism.</span>

<h2>Plan to achieve:</h2>
    <div style="color:#000; text-align:left">
<ul> <li> <span>Our
        overall goal is to produce an interactive Go playing program
        that can play a legal game of Go with a human through a web
        interface, and evaluates possible moves by parallel MCTS. The
        tasks by project component are:</span>

    </li>

</ul>

<ol start="1"> <li class="c2
    c4"> <span>Web interface: Adapt an existing Javascript-based Go
        interface to allow a user to view the board state and make
        moves. The web interface will be run on a local computer
        and be accessible through non-local clients. </span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>Master process: Implement communication
        with web interface, aggregate the results of the MCTS search,
        calculate best available move, and play the best available
        move through web interface with a 30s/move time limit
        (ideally, also test with a 10s/move time limit).</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>MCTS search system: Implement a
        multi-threaded MCTS search program in C++ to play random games
        which plays random games and report the results to the master
        process. An initial implementation can use a rough heuristic
        without a neural network, but we expect to have neural network
        evaluation in our final implementation</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>Distribution: run MCTS search threads
        across multiple machines.</span>

    </li>

<h2>Hope to achieve:</h2>
    <div style="color:#000; text-align:left">
<ul> <li>
    <span>Adapt the MCTS search system to improve the CNN with
    reinforcement learning</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>GPU-accelerate CNN evaluation (should be
        feasible with existing library features)</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>Asynchronously distribute CNN evaluation
        results among search threads to minimize work
    duplication</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>Be able to beat very bad Go AIs (e.g.
        EasyBot, KGS rank ~27k)</span>
<ul> <li>
    <span>Be able to beat Joe (KGS online rank 13k -- lower
    &ldquo;k&rdquo; is better)</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>Better yet, beat someone better than Joe
        (i.e., someone ~4k, or a Go AI of similar rank)</span>

    </li>

    <li> <span>Almost impossibly, beat one of the top Go
        AIs like Zen (6d, 6 ranks higher than 1k)</span>

<span>&nbsp;For the web frontend, Javascript is the only choice. For
    the web server and the network layer (i.e. managing the
    distributed MCTS search threads), we would like to use Python --
    Flask makes web hosting and REST APIs extremely simple to
    implement, and we expect that implementing the network layer in
    Python will make work distribution much simpler to implement -- it
    may be less efficient than a C++ implementation, but distributed
    processing is error-prone, and we think that that a simpler
    implementation with fewer bugs can make up for the overhead of
Python. For the search threads themselves, we would like to use C++,
to maximize performance.</span>

</p>

<p> <span>Ideally, we would like to parallelize the MCTS on
    a cluster of machines. Latedays is not feasible for our main use
    case because its execution model is job-oriented. We would prefer
    to utilize a service like Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, or Google
    Cloud, but we could also make use of a few GHC machines to do the
    computation. We would prefer access to machines capable of GPU
    acceleration of the neural network evaluation -- GHC machines
    would be suitable, but since they are a shared resource we&rsquo;d
    like to try other options as well.</span>
